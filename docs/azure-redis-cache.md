# Azure Redis Cache Service

[Azure Redis Cache](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cache/) is based on the popular open-source Redis cache. It gives you access to a secure, dedicated Redis cache, managed by Microsoft and accessible from any application within Azure. This broker currently publishes a single service and plan for provisioning Azure Redis Cache.

## Create an Azure Redis Cache service

1. Get the service name and plans

  ```
  cf marketplace
  ```

  Sample output:

  ```
  service                       plans                        description
  azure-rediscache              basic*, standard*, premium*  Azure Redis Cache Service
  ```

  If you can not find the service name, please use the following command to make the plans public.

  ```
  cf enable-service-access azure-rediscache
  ```

2. Create a service instance

  Configuration parameters are supported with the provision request. These parameters are passed in a valid JSON object containing configuration parameters, provided either in-line or in a file.

  ```
  cf create-service azure-rediscache $service_plan $service_instance_name -c $path_to_parameters
  ```

  Supported configuration parameters:

  ```
  {
    "resourceGroup": "<resource-group-name>", // [Required] Unique. Only allow up to 90 characters
    "cacheName": "<cache-name>",              // [Required] Unique. Must be between 3 and 63 characters long. Can only contain numbers, letters, and the - character. The cache name cannot start or end with the - character, and consecutive - characters are not valid.
    "parameters": {
      "location": "<location>",               // [Required] e.g. eastasia, eastus2, westus, etc. You can use azure cli command 'azure location list' to list all locations.
      "enableNonSslPort": true | false,
      "sku": {                                // [Required] EXAMPLE: Basic C 0 for cache size 250MB, low network performance and 256 client connections. See more skus: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cache/
        "name": "<sku-name>",
        "family": "<sku-family>",
        "capacity": <capacity>
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  For example:

  ```
  cf create-service azure-rediscache basic myrediscache -c examples/rediscache-example-config.json
  ```

  The contents of `examples/rediscache-example-config.json`:

  ```
  {
    "resourceGroup": "redisResourceGroup",
    "cacheName": "mycache",
    "parameters": {
      "location": "eastus",
      "enableNonSslPort": false,
      "sku": {
        "name": "Basic",
        "family": "C",
        "capacity": 0
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  
  >**NOTE:** Please remove the comments in the JSON file before you use it.

3. Check the operation status of creating the service instance

  The creating operation is asynchronous. You can get the operation status after the creating operation.

  ```
  cf service $service_instance_name
  ```

  For example:

  ```
  cf service myrediscache
  ```

## Using the services in your application

### Binding

  ```
  cf bind-service $app_name $service_instance_name
  ```

  For example:

  ```
  cf bind-service demoapp myrediscache
  ```

### Format of Credentials

  Verify that the credentials are set as environment variables

  ```
  cf env $app_name
  ```

  The credentials have the following format:
  
  ```
  "credentials": {
     "hostname": "<cache-name>.redis.cache.windows.net",
     "name": "<cache-name>",
     "port": 6379,
     "primaryKey": "<primary-key>",
     "secondaryKey": "<secondary-key>",
     "sslPort": 6380
  }
  ```

## Unbinding

  ```
  cf unbind-service $app_name $service_instance_name
  ```

  For example:

  ```
  cf unbind-service demoapp myrediscache
  ```

## Delete the service instance

  ```
  cf delete-service $service_instance_name -f
  ```

  For example:

  ```
  cf delete-service myrediscache -f
  ```
