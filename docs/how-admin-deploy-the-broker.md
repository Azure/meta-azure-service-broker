# How a Cloud Foundry Admin manages the meta Azure service broker

## Deploy the meta Azure service broker as an application in Cloud Foundry

1. Get the source code from Github.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Azure/meta-azure-service-broker
  cd meta-azure-service-broker
  ```

2. Update `config/default.json`.

  1. Create a SQL database.

    You have several options to create a SQL database.

    * [Create an Azure SQL database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sql-database-get-started/)
    * Create a SQL server VM on Azure
    
    **Please ensure you've created a server-level firewall rule.**

  2. Create tables in the SQL database.

    1. Use your favorite way to connect to the SQL database.

      For example:

      ```
      sudo npm install -g sql-cli
      mssql --server "<server-name>.database.windows.net" --database <database> --user <username>@<server-name> --pass <pass> --encrypt
      ```

    2. Create tables `instances` and `bindings` according to [schema.sql](../scripts/schema.sql).

  2. Update the configurations.

    Update `config/default.json` with the configurations of the SQL database.

3. Update `manifest.yml` with your credentials.

  * Common Configurations

    ```
    ENVIRONMENT: REPLACE-ME
    SUBSCRIPTION_ID: REPLACE-ME
    TENANT_ID: REPLACE-ME
    CLIENT_ID: REPLACE-ME
    CLIENT_SECRET: REPLACE-ME
    ```

    These configurations should be matched:

    * ENVIRONMENT

      Two options `AzureCloud` and `AzureChinaCloud` are supported as an `ENVIRONMENT`. For example, if you want to create services in `AzureChinaCloud`, you should specify `AzureChinaCloud` as the `ENVIRONMENT`.

      The following table is about the support for each service in different environments.

      | Service Name | AzureCloud | AzureChinaCloud |
      |:---|:---|:---|
      | DocumentDB Service | yes | yes |
      | Event Hub Service | yes | yes |
      | Redis Cache Service | yes | yes |
      | Service Bus Service | yes | yes |
      | Storage Blob Service | yes | yes |
      | SQL Database Service | yes | yes |

    * SUBSCRIPTION_ID

      You can list the providers in the subscription, and make sure that the namespace is registered. For example, if you want to enable Service Bus service, `Microsoft.ServiceBus` should be registered. If the specific provider is not registered, you need to run `azure provider register <PROVIDER-NAME>` to register it.

      ```
      $ azure provider list
      info:    Executing command provider list
      + Getting ARM registered providers
      data:    Namespace                  Registered
      data:    -------------------------  -------------
      data:    Microsoft.Batch            Registered
      data:    Microsoft.Cache            Registered
      data:    Microsoft.Compute          Registered
      data:    Microsoft.DocumentDB       Registered
      data:    Microsoft.EventHub         Registered
      data:    microsoft.insights         Registered
      data:    Microsoft.KeyVault         Registered
      data:    Microsoft.MySql            Registered
      data:    Microsoft.Network          Registering
      data:    Microsoft.ServiceBus       Registered
      data:    Microsoft.Sql              Registered
      data:    Microsoft.Storage          Registered
      data:    Microsoft.ApiManagement    NotRegistered
      data:    Microsoft.Authorization    Registered
      data:    Microsoft.ClassicCompute   NotRegistered
      data:    Microsoft.ClassicNetwork   NotRegistered
      data:    Microsoft.ClassicStorage   NotRegistered
      data:    Microsoft.Devices          NotRegistered
      data:    Microsoft.Features         Registered
      data:    Microsoft.HDInsight        NotRegistered
      data:    Microsoft.Resources        Registered
      data:    Microsoft.Scheduler        Registered
      data:    Microsoft.ServiceFabric    NotRegistered
      data:    Microsoft.StreamAnalytics  NotRegistered
      data:    Microsoft.Web              NotRegistered
      info:    provider list command OK
      ```

    * A [service principal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/) is composed of `TENANT_ID`, `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.

    * About the roles of the service principal.

      In [Azure CPI guidance](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-azure-cpi-release/tree/master/docs), the roles `Virtual Machine Contributor` and `Network Contributor` are recommended to deploy Cloud Foundry on Azure. However, for the service broker, these two roles are not enough. You can follow [RBAC: Built-in roles](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/role-based-access-built-in-roles/) to get the appropriate roles.

      For example, you can use `Storage Account Contributor` if you only use the service broker to create a storage account.

      If you want to create all the services, you may need the role `Contributor`.

4. Push the broker to Cloud Foundry

  ```
  cf push
  ```

## Register a service broker

```
cf create-service-broker demo-service-broker $authUser $authPassword <URL of the app meta-azure-service-broker>
```

`$authUser` and `$authPassword` should be same as the ones in `config/default.json`.

## Make the plans public

```
cf enable-service-access $service-name
```

For example:

```
cf enable-service-access azure-storageblob
```

Show the services in the marketplace to verify they are ready.

```
cf marketplace
```

## Unregister a service broker

```
cf delete-service-broker demo-service-broker -f
```

## Debug logging

By default, the debug logging is disabled. If you want to enable the debug logging, please remove `debug` from the `suppress` list in `.logule.json`. Here is the [reference](https://github.com/clux/logule#configuration).

```
"stdout"    : {
  "pad"       : 0,
  "delimiter" : " - ",
  "nesting"   : 3,
  "mutable"   : true,
  "timestamp" : "toLocaleTimeString",
  "suppress"  : ["debug"]
},
```

You can enable the debug logging when you deploy the service broker at the first time. Then you will get the debug messages. On the other hand, you can also enable it after the service broker is registered, but you need to update the service broker. The steps:

1. Enable debug logging in `.logule.json`.

2. Re-push the broker to Cloud Foundry.

3. Update the service broker.

  ```
  cf update-service-broker demo-service-broker $authUser $authPassword <URL of the app meta-azure-service-broker>
  ```
